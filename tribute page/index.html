                <h2>The Destroyer </h2>
                <p>
                    <bW>Shiva or Mahadeva</bW> is the supreme god in Shaivism tradition in Hinduism and one of the chief deities as a member of the
                    Trimurti. Shiva is causeless auspiciousness. Shiva is known as the Maha Rudra (the master of all Rudras). Shiva is an
                    embodiment of ultimate space of enlightenment. He assumed human form to guide humans in the past and thus is known as
                    Adhiguru (first guru).
                    
                    His space of enlightenment is what all spiritual seekers aspire for. All enlightened masters live in this space of
                    Shiva. Shiva is known as the destroyer god because he removes all evil from the world. His wife is the goddess Parvati
                    or Devi Durga.
                    
                    According to Hindu legend, he has a blue neck because he swallowed a poison in order to save the universe. He has three
                    eyes, the third eye is on his forehead. Shiva is one-third of the Hindu trimurti including Brahma and Vishnu. Lord Shiva
                    lives in the Mount Kailash with his two sons Kartikeya and Ganesha who is known as the Remover of Obstacles. There is a
                    statue of Shiva in Bangalore which is a great tourist attraction.
